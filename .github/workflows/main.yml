      # 3. Install dependencies and build the Next.js static export
      #    npm ci = clean install from package-lock.json (faster & deterministic)
      #    npm run build = runs "next build" which outputs to client/out/

      # 4. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers using wrangler
      #    Uses wrangler.jsonc config which points to ./out as the assets directory
      #    --commit-dirty=true silences the "uncommitted changes" warning in CI
